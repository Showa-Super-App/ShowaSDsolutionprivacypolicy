    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: 30 May 2024</strong></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") outline the rules and regulations for using the Showa Maintenance Provider app ("we," "our," "us"). By accessing or using our services, you agree to these Terms. If you disagree with any part of these Terms, please do not use our services.</p>

    <h2>Account Registration</h2>
    <p><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Users must be at least 18 years old to create an account and access our services. This ensures compliance with legal requirements and protects minors from unauthorized use of our services.</p>
    <p><strong>Account Information:</strong> Users must provide accurate and complete information during registration and keep their details updated. This includes providing a valid email address, phone number, and any other required information. Inaccurate or incomplete information may result in the suspension or termination of your account.</p>

    <h2>Services Overview</h2>
    <p><strong>Maintenance Monitoring:</strong> Customers can add sensors to machines to monitor vibration and temperature data. These sensors are linked to the customerâ€™s mobile app account, allowing real-time monitoring and alerts for any irregularities.</p>
    <p><strong>Predictive Maintenance:</strong> Customers can request predictive maintenance based on the data collected from the sensors. This helps in preventing potential failures and prolonging the lifespan of the machinery.</p>
    <p><strong>Service Provider Platform:</strong> Service providers can create maintenance companies, add maintenance engineers, and sell products in the Showa marketplace. This platform facilitates the coordination and management of maintenance services.</p>

    <h2>Subscription and Fees</h2>
    <p><strong>Subscription Fee:</strong> Service providers must pay a subscription fee to use the app for providing maintenance services. This fee grants access to the service provider app and its features. The subscription model helps maintain the quality and availability of our services.</p>
    <p><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> Showa (Admin) manages payments for maintenance services based on Showa's pricing policy. The cost of maintenance is calculated based on the time required to complete the service. Showa pays the service provider, but the cost of any equipment or parts needed for maintenance must be covered by the customer.</p>

    <h2>Maintenance Service Process</h2>
    <p><strong>Service Requests:</strong> Customers can request maintenance services through the app. Service providers receive notifications and are responsible for carrying out the maintenance. The app facilitates scheduling and communication between customers and service providers.</p>
    <p><strong>Equipment Responsibility:</strong> Showa will not take responsibility for any equipment damaged during maintenance. This responsibility lies with the service provider and the maintenance engineer. Any damages or losses must be addressed between the customer and the service provider.</p>
    <p><strong>Accurate Reporting:</strong> Maintenance engineers must provide accurate and truthful information in their reports. If an engineer intentionally provides false information, both the engineer and the maintenance company may be suspended for one year. This ensures integrity and trust in our services.</p>
    <p><strong>Natural Disasters:</strong> Showa will not be held responsible for any incidents occurring during maintenance work due to natural disasters. This includes earthquakes, floods, storms, and other uncontrollable events.</p>

    <h2>User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p><strong>Compliance with Laws:</strong> Users must adhere to all relevant laws and regulations while using our services. This includes following safety standards and legal requirements for maintenance work.</p>
    <p><strong>Account Security:</strong> Users are responsible for keeping their account information secure and are accountable for all activities under their account. Unauthorized use or breaches should be reported to Showa immediately.</p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p><strong>Rights:</strong> All intellectual property rights in the app and services are owned by Showa or its licensors. Users are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the app in accordance with these Terms. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property is prohibited.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p><strong>No Warranty:</strong> The services are provided "as-is" without any warranty. Showa disclaims all implied warranties, including fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of our services.</p>
    <p><strong>Liability Limitation:</strong> Showa is not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use of our services. This includes loss of data, loss of profits, or any other damages resulting from service interruptions or errors.</p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p><strong>By Showa:</strong> We may suspend or terminate your account at our discretion, without prior notice, if you breach these Terms. This includes violations of our policies or legal requirements.</p>
    <p><strong>By User:</strong> You may terminate your account anytime following the instructions within the app. Upon termination, your access to the services will be revoked, and your data will be handled according to our Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Japan, and any disputes will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Japanese courts. This ensures that legal matters are handled within the appropriate legal framework.</p>

    <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may revise these Terms occasionally. We will notify users of any changes by posting the updated Terms on this page. Continued use of the services after changes are posted signifies acceptance of the new Terms. Users are encouraged to review these Terms periodically.</p>
